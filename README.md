# Hugo template

This website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), one of the most popular open-source static site generators. 

## Installation 

For macOS:
```
$ brew install hugo
```
For Windows: 
```
$ choco install hugo-extended
```
For more detailed guidelines, see [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

## Local Development

Start Hugo’s development server to view the site:
```
hugo server
```

This command starts a local development server and opens the website in a browser window. Changes are reflected live without having to restart the server after you save your changes in the local code editor. Press Ctrl + C to stop Hugo’s development server.

## Deployment

Deploy your site directly to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, an AWS S3 bucket, or an Azure Storage container with the following command: 
```
hugo deploy
```
>**Note:** This feature requires the Hugo extended/deploy edition. See the [documentation](https://gohugo.io/installation/) for details.
