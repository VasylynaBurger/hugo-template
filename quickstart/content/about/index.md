title: About our sample Hugo site
---

This site has been created as part of a docs-as-code training. Using Hugo, an open-source static site generator, this training highlights how Technical Writers can collaborate seamlessly to build, manage, and publish documentation in a code-driven environment.

### Purpose of This Site:

* Serve as a learning resource for individuals exploring docs-as-code methodologies.
* Showcase best practices in content organization, version control, and publishing using Hugo.
* Provide a sandbox environment to experiment with Hugo's features, Markdown syntax, and CI/CD workflows.

**Thank you for visiting! We hope this site inspires you to embrace docs-as-code and explore the many possibilities it offers.**
